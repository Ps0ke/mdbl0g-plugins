# FancyBox
This adds a lightbox-like popup viewer for images. It comes really handy if your theme has a narrow content column and the images get resized very small. The will pop out and the reader is able to view them bigger.

Works with `<img>` tags as well as with Markdown `![alttext](imgurl)`.

# Dependencies
You need to install the [jQuery mdbl0g Plugin]() and set the `JQUERY_VERSION` to min. `1.4`.
