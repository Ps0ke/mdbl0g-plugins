# mdbl0g Vimeo Plugin
Works for `vimeo.com` and supports `http://` and `https://` (But doesn't embed via `https://`).

It transorms the following links to Vimeo videos into embedded videos:

    [Awesome foobar video!](http(s)://www.vimeo.com/23422342)
    [Awesome foobar video!](http(s)://vimeo.com/23422343)
	
But also replaces blank URLS

    http(s)://www.vimeo.com/23422342
    http(s)://vimeo.com/23422342
